# MIMETH
Contains main code that produced results of article "The Immune Factors Driving DNA Methylation Variation in Human Blood". Please note that this is the raw code that produced the main results of the article. Due to legal and ethical constraints we cannot upload donor data in this setting. It will therefore not be possible to reproduce our results based solely on this repository. All Milieu Intérieur datasets can be accessed by submitting a data access request to milieuinterieurdac@pasteur.fr, the Milieu Intérieur data access committee, which grants data access if the request is consistent with the informed consent provided by Milieu Intérieur participants. Please note that the uploaded code was intended to run on the Institute Pasteur slurm computing server on a file system of preprocessed files setup for efficent computation. It might therefore not always be straightforward to read. [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/527968587.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/527968587)
